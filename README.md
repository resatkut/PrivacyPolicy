# Privacy Policy
Resat Kut created the "APPNAME" app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Resat Kut free of charge and is intended to be used as is. This page is used to inform visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.
If you choose to use my service, you consent to the collection and use of information related to this policy. The Personal Information I collect is used to provide and improve the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from Secure Contacts, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, when using our Service, I may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information I request will be stored on your device and will not be collected by me in any way.

## Log Data

I would like to inform you that every time you use my service, I collect data and information called Log Data on your phone (through third party products) in case of an error in the application. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the application when using My Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. .

## Cookie

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are often used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites you visit and are stored in your device's internal memory.
This Service does not explicitly use these "cookies". However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve its services. You have the option of accepting or rejecting these cookies and you know when a cookie is sent to your device. If you choose to decline our cookies, you may not be able to use some parts of this Service.

## Security

I value your trust in providing your Personal Information to us, so we strive to use commercially acceptable methods of protection. Note, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service does not contain links to other sites. However, if redirected, please note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services and assume no responsibility.

## Children's Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children not to submit any personally identifiable information through the App and/or Services. I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet use and assist in enforcing this Policy by instructing them never to provide personally identifiable information through the App and/or Services without their consent. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information through the App and/or Services, please contact us. In addition, you must be at least 16 years old to allow the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do this on your behalf).
Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. It is therefore recommended that you periodically review this page for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
This policy is effective from 04-01-2023.
